<h2 id="Accord">Honda Accord</h2>
<p>The Honda Accord /əˈkɔːrd/ is a series of automobiles manufactured by Honda since 1976, best known for its four-door sedan variant, which has been one of the best-selling cars in the United States since 1989. The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including coupes, wagons, hatchbacks and a crossover. The Honda Accord mainly competes against cars such as Buick's Regal, Chevrolet's Malibu, Ford's Fusion, Hyundai's Elantra, Kia's Optima, Mitsubishi's Lancer, Nissan's Altima, Toyota's Corolla and Volkswagen's Passat. </p>

<p>In 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville, Ohio at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for fifteen years (1982–97), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold.[2] Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles.[3] The Accord has been on the Car and Driver 10Best list a record 30 times.[4]</p>

<p>Since initiation, Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976 as a compact hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the line-up was expanded to include a sedan, coupé, and wagon. By the Accord's sixth generation in the 1990s, it evolved into an intermediate vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets. For the eighth generation of the Accord released for the North America market in 2007, Honda had again chosen to move the model further up-scale and increase its size.[5] This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car,[6] with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car. The current ninth generation Accord for the North America market is again classified as a mid-size car, falls just short of full-size car classification with the combined interior space of 119 cubic feet (3.4 m3).</p>

<h2 id="HR-V">Honda HR-V</h2>
<p>The Honda HR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Honda spanning two generations. The first generation HR-V was based on the Honda Logo and sold in Japan and selective Asia-Pacific markets between 1999 and 2006. The second generation HR-V was based on third-generation Honda Fit and went on sale in North America, Australia, Brazil, and selective Asian markets in 2015. The second generation HR-V was largely identical to the JDM Vezel which went on sale in late 2013.</p>

<p>The abbreviation HR-V, according to Honda's HR-V history website,[1] officially stands for Hi-rider Revolutionary Vehicle, while the other stands for Hip and Smart Runabout Vehicle.[2] The HR-V was introduced to cater for the demand for vehicles with the benefits of SUVs (in particular its larger cousin CR-V), such as increased cargo room and higher visibility, along with the maneuverability, performance and fuel economy of a smaller car.</p>

<h2 id="Outback">Subaru Outback</h2>
<p>The Subaru Outback is an automotive nameplate used by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI) since 1994. The "Outback" name has been utilized on two different Subaru branded vehicles. One of these models is based on the mid-sized Subaru Legacy and the other derived from the hatchback version of the Subaru Impreza. The model is named after the vast, remote, and arid outback regions in Australia; the name is intended to emphasize the moderate off-road capability of the vehicle, while also giving a nod to the original design, which had a larger trunk "out back" than the Legacy.</p>
