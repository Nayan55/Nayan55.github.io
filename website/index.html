		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Nayan Nair, and I was born on October 19 2004 in Mountain View, California. The school I was in before I came to Valley Christian Junior High was Carden Academy of Almaden. I didn't want to leave, but when I saw this campus, I just could resist the opportunity to come here.</p>
		<p>When I came here in sixth grade the electives that I took were Video Journalism and PLTW Medical Detectives and Green Architecture. The next year, I took PLTW I and ISS, which was the best year ever. This year, I am taking Intro to Programming and PLTW Design and Robotics.</p>
